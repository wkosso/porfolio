   <p> My experience studying Informatics at Indiana University has been an exciting journey. My main focus has been on Human-Computer Interaction and New Media Development, with a major in Informatics. Alongside my extensive background in HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, and PHP, I have also developed proficiency in modern frameworks like React.</p> <p>This strong technological foundation allows me to create responsive, visually appealing, and functional web applications. However, what truly drives me is combining these technical skills with UX research and design. My expertise lies in identifying and satisfying user needs, steering my work towards solutions that are both intuitive and user-friendly.</p>Outside the classroom, Informatics is more than a field of study for me—it's a passion. I pride myself on my strong work ethic, perseverance, and constant desire to learn. Acquiring knowledge isn't just a career pursuit; it's a personal journey. I actively seek opportunities to learn new skills, embrace challenges, and expand my horizons in this ever-evolving industry.</div>
